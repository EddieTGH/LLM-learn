## ðŸŽ¯ **Responsive Design Improvements**

### **Mobile-First Approach (430x932px optimized)**
- **Typography Scaling**: Progressive text sizes from `tw-text-3xl` on mobile to `tw-text-6xl` on desktop
- **Flexible Layouts**: Converted fixed widths to responsive `tw-w-full` with max-width constraints
- **Smart Spacing**: Reduced padding/margins on mobile (`tw-px-4 tw-py-8`) scaling up to desktop (`tw-px-6 tw-py-12`)

### **Header & Navigation**
- **Dynamic Menu Width**: 75vw for screens â‰¤430px, 60vw for larger mobile screens
- **Improved Touch Targets**: Larger tap areas for mobile menu items
- **Auto-Close Menu**: Menu closes when navigation links are clicked
- **Orientation Handling**: Menu adjusts properly during device rotation

### **Hero Section**
- **Responsive Images**: Dashboard image scales from 280x280px on mobile to 650x550px on desktop
- **Flexible Forms**: Email input uses `tw-flex-1` to fill available space
- **Centered Layout**: Content centers properly on mobile with `max-xl:tw-mx-auto`

### **Features Section**
- **Stacked Layout**: Cards stack vertically on mobile, horizontal on desktop
- **Responsive Images**: Feature images scale appropriately (150px â†’ 200px)

- **Z-index Management**: Proper layering for mobile menu
